"""Yolo-Auto provider profile for Hermes Agent.

Registers Yolo-Auto (https://yolo-auto.com) as the ``yolo-auto`` provider over
its OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. Everything else, credential
resolution, the ``/model`` picker, ``hermes doctor``, the ``--provider`` flag,
and the setup wizard, auto-wires from the provider registry, so this plugin
touches no Hermes core files.

Model auto-discovery is the default Hermes path: the picker fetches
``{base_url}/models`` with Bearer auth on lookup. Yolo-Auto's ``/v1/models``
returns exactly the models the caller's API key can use, plan-filtered, already
ordered, so the picker stays honest without any curated list. ``fallback_models``
only matters offline or when the endpoint is down.

Hermes core moves fast and a plugin does not choose the user's build, so the
profile fields we set are filtered to what the installed ``ProviderProfile``
dataclass actually accepts. See ``_supported_kwargs``: passing a newer field to
an older build raises TypeError at import, and the loader swallows it, leaving
the user with "unknown provider" and no cause. Filtering degrades to a slightly
less capable profile instead of a silent registration failure.

Maintained by Yolo-Auto. No affiliate, referral, or attribution headers are
added to model requests.

# the dashboard's /api/model/info. Values mirror what the Yolo-Auto proxy
# actually enforces or translates per model:
#   - yolo is the flagship alias: tool calls, image input, and a thinking knob
#     the proxy maps reasoning levels onto
#   - yolo-small is text-only and always thinks; its request profile passes
#     bodies through unchanged, so it advertises no level switch and Hermes
#     should not offer one
# Any other model your key can run still appears in the picker through live
# discovery; Hermes falls back to its generic unknown-model handling for
# models not declared here.
